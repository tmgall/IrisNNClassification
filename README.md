# Iris Neural Network Classification

This is my first entirely independent machine learning project. I wrote all of the code in this project referencing only mathematical theory (no preexisting code). 

After looking through some data sets available online, this one seemed to be the most popular as well as the most approachable, so I decided to create a deep learning model for it. Here's a link to the repository where I found the set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris. 

I wrote it in Python, and the only libraries I used were Pandas (for data organization and easy display) and NumPy (for handling the linear algebra). 

To test the code, run each cell. The very last cell will actually train the neural network and output the accuracy of the values for theta. The set only has 150 training examples, which ended up being around 45 test cases, so the accuracy is not highly tested, but after some testing I found the accuracy to hover around 95%--sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how many iterations of gradient descent I allowed the algorithm to undergo. 

Some next steps to for the code would be to generalize it to any number of hidden layers, as my code only allows for exactly one hidden layer. 

I'm very proud of this project and I hope to make more deep learning projects in the future.
